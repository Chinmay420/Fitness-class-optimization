# Fitness class optimization
Business problem: Some of the members booking a fitness class do not show up and  the business is not able to book other members for that time slot due to
limited capacity.
Solution : Make a classification model that predicts whether a particular member will show up for a booked session or not. If they are likely to not show up
the business can book other members for that time slot.
